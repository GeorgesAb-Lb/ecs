			  UPDATE INSTRUCTIONS

This file contains update instructions which will have to be performed
in addition to the usual steps. In chronological order:

--- Production state Nov. 2015 ---

* 2015-11-26: Full backup required

  Due to heavy refactoring of the document storage, modification and
  retrieval facilities it is of uttermost importance to perform a full
  backup _before_ upgrading production to the newest version.

	$ cp -R ~/ecs-storage-vault ~/ecs-storage-vault.bak
	$ pg_dump -Fc -Ox ecs > ~/`date +F`.pgdump

  Better backup too much, than not enough!

* 2015-11-26: Mediaserver removal

  The mediaserver has been removed. The caching and rendering
  directories can be removed.

	$ rm -rf ~/ecs-rendercache ~/ecs-doccache

* 2015-11-26: Handling of incominng files

  Due to refactoring of the document upload pipeline, the incoming file
  directory is not used anymore.

	$ rm -rf ~/ecs-incoming ~/ecs-temp/incoming-copy

* 2015-11-27: Removal of the genfile directory

  The genfile directory has not been used for quite some time now. The
  related settings in settings.py have been removed.

	$ rm -rf ~/ecs-generated

--- Next release ---
