Intermediate Solution to initialize the PDF viewer demo 
-------------------------------------------------------

To fill the memcachedb with the two demo sets, issue:

  ./manage.py render static/mediaserver/images/ecs-09-submission-form.pdf 1
  ./manage.py render static/mediaserver/images/test-pdf-14-seitig.pdf 2

or whereever you keep the above mentioned PDF docs.


Note regarding shredder:

The shredder environment shares the memcachedb with the ecsdev developer 
environments. So initial memcache fill from a dev env is possible, but
of course also accidental wreckage.
